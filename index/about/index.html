    <h3>About Me</h3>
      I am known as Array, I am a Mechanical Engineering student. My hobbies are skateboarding, biking, and play video
      games (including emulation). I tinker a lot
      with electronics and tend to
      jailbreak and homebrew them whenever possible (I can't live wit stock software). I use <a
        href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux<i class="fa fa-archlinux" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (its not hard I
      promise), and
      do programming as a hobby. I'm not a developer, just a person with a lot of time. I'm pretty skilled at using the
      terminal (on a Linux system lol). I created this website and it's <a
        href="https://github.com/array-in-a-matrix/arrayinamatrix.xyz">source code</a> is open. My website is my longest
      running project and I constantly update it with new content (come back later!). I set up, configured, host, and
      operate this website,
      and all of its related services (I have
      physical access to the server). I support <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/">FOSS</a>
      (<strong>F</strong>ree [as in
      freedom not price], and <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ourced <Strong>S</Strong>oftware), value privacy
      and want a decentralized internet.

      You can view my blog <a href="../../blog/">here</a>, this is a space where I ramble about stuff and write dump
      information I believe is important or interesting. I did not code the blog site, instead i used <a
        href="https://html5up.net">HTML5UP</a>'s <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a> template (this is why I
      didn't include it in my site's source code).
