    <h3>Rock Paper Scissors 🪨📄✂️</h3>

    <code>
      The first game I ever made! I wrote this when I first began learning Javascript, to be specific I wrote the logic during that time. The game was only playable through the terminal, now its fairly portable and can be integrated into anything.

    <h3>Eternal Space</h3>
    <p><a href="./eternalspace/">Click to play.</a></p>
    <code>
     Currently only playable on a pc, I haven't tried figuring out how to scale down the game lol. I participated in the Opera GX + GameMaker game jam and created this monstrosity. The game jam was alien themed, however I never got that far. Before taking part in this game jam I have never programmed an actual game nor have been in a game jam. I learned how to program in GameMaker Language (basically Javascript) during the event.
